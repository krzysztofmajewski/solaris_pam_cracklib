Make sure you have cracklib - you'll need the header packer.h,
the shared library libcrack.so, and a dictionary compiled to work with
cracklib. One way to satisfy this requirement is to search the net for
Alec Muffett's cracklib, download it, build it, and install it. 
But there may be other ways. (This package does not come with any
part of cracklib.)

Make sure you have GNU make. 
Look through the GNUmakefile. 
Type 'make' to build, 'make install' (as root) to install.
